    ##Task condition

I had dilemmas about what do function getAllPrices() and if can I send multiple instruments to getLatestPrice(instrument). The task would be much cleaner if you added examples with responses to those functions or I could ask you about it (or added mocked server). My solution was based on the fact that getAllPrices() return all start prices, and getLatestPrice(instrument) accepts only one instrument. I understand that it is not optimal and in this case, with hundreds of instruments, it will be dangerous for the server.
