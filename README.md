# Hello another side!

First of all, thank you for considering me for the recruitment task. I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my skills and abilities. I am grateful for the chance to potentially join your team and contribute to the success of the company.

## Task condition

I had dilemmas about what function `getAllPrices()` does and if I can send multiple instruments to `getLatestPrice(instrument)`. The would have been much clearer if you provided examples with responses to those functions or added mocked server. My solution was based on the fact that `getAllPrices()` return all start prices, and `getLatestPrice(instrument)` accepts only one instrument. I understand that it is not optimal and in this case, with hundreds of instruments, it will be dangerous for the server.

## Requirements
