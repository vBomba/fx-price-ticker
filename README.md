Hello another side!

First of all, thank you for considering me for the recruitment task. I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my skills and abilities. I am grateful for the chance to potentially join your team and contribute to the success of the company.

    **********Task condition********

I had dilemmas about what do function getAllPrices() and if can I send multiple instruments to getLatestPrice(instrument). The task would be much cleaner if you added examples with responses to those functions or I could ask you about it (or added mocked server). My solution was based on the fact that getAllPrices() return all start prices, and getLatestPrice(instrument) accepts only one instrument. I understand that it is not optimal and in this case, with hundreds of instruments, it will be dangerous for the server.

    **********Requirements********

Angular CLI: 15^
Node: 18^
